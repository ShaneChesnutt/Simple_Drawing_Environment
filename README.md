Simple Drawing Environment
----------------------------------
Release 1.0.0

This project was made for my Cpsc 337 class (Intro to Web Graphics)

This web application is written in javascript/SVG. The UI is written in SVG and the controllers are written in javascript.

Basics -
This is a drawing interface that allows you to draw and edit basic shapes (circles, ellipses, and squares) in svg.

The way the size tool works is to click on a drawn shape and then hover over one of the squares produced by the tool and use your mouse wheel to resize.

**TODO:**
-------------------------
* Clean up javascript code base
* Investigate html5 svg tag
* Create a feature list to add
