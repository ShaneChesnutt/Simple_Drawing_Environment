Simple Drawing Environment
----------------------------------

This project was made for my Cpsc 337 class (Intro to Web Graphics) 

This web application is just javascript/SVG the UI is written in SVG and the controls are written in javascript.

Basics - 
This is a drawing interface that allows you to draw and edit basic shapes (circles, ellipses, and squares) in svg.

The way size tool works is click on a shape and then hover over one of the squares and use your mouse wheel to resize.

BUGS - 
Sizing issues with the screen. 
Click events on the buttons (This is due to the svg text over the button).
